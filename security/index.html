  <p>Introduction: This project is composed of a server and a web app. The server
    gathers information on the clients, such as whether they are a vehicle or a 
    passenger, their username, their geolocation, and the time at which the info
    was sent. The web app is a map that uses the server data to locate nearby
    passengers or vehicles. The purpose of this assignment was to test for 
    vulnerabilities in the program - i.e, mechanisms by which a user can either 
    alter the pre-existing program or retrieve more data than the server intends 
    to share. 
  </p>
  <p>Methodology: I didn't use any external tools such as Burpsuite or ZAP. I
    used "curl" to send data to the server. My first few rounds of black-box 
    testing were fruitless, and my partner had actually warned me that some of 
    the example tests we'd seen in class wouldn't work on his program. For this
    reason, I quickly downloaded and inspected his code in order to follow 
    his process more closely and find sites for vulernability.
  </p>
  <p>Findings:
    I found that certain mechanisms for storing data that weren't necessarily
    intended to be for security purposes actually functioned to provide security
    in my partner's program. His program is pretty strict on data checking, and 
    this practice augmented the security. I will address two failed attacks, and
    why they failed due his particular implementation. The injection attack I tried
    did fail. An injection attack is when a hacker tries to tamper with or get access 
    to the information stored in the database. I was, however, able to 
    perform a a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack when entering passenger data. 
    XSS attacks are when a user sends data to the server that actually goes in
    and appends new / alters pre-existing code in the program, resulting in 
    unintended behavior. 
  </p>
  <p>Issues Found:
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			The issue: Database injection</br>
        Location: /rides POST route. Viewed in terminal via curl.</br>
        Severity: Negative. His program protects against this attack.</br>
        Description: When sending data to the server, I tried to access all the 
        vehicle data in the database using the [$ne] operator. The data I sent 
        to the server looked like this: "username[$ne]=&lat=1&lng=2". This was 
        intended to have the program send back all the vehicles whose username
        is <i>not equal</i> to...the empty field. So, that would catch all the
        vehicles, since none of them have an empty username! While this attack
        works on my own program, it does not work on my partner's. This is due
        to the flow of his implementation: he calls find() to gather all documents
        from the collection, and then manually does a check to see if they don't
        match the specified criteria, subsequently removing them.
