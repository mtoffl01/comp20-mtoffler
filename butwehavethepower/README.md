1. As far as I know, all parts of the work have been implemented correctly.
2. I didn't collaborate with anyone. I did attend Robert Yang's office hours and he helped me with connecting elements from the html file to variables in javascript. I also, obviously, got a lot of inspiration from the DoubleRainbow example online.
3. I probably spent about 1.5 hours on this assignment.
