1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
To host all my semester projects for Comp20!
2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was probably the semester group project. It's been really fun using our
freedom to make ... whatever I want to make! With lots of assignments in C++, I felt severely
limited by my own ability to understand the complexities of the language and my program. But
HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT, there are soooo many resources available - from API's, to clear
stackoverflow posts, the semester group project made me feel excited about all that I have
the potential to create.
3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
So much! Prior to this class, I had never written code in any language other than C++, and I
was terrified to try anything else. This class has really taught me the value of a foundational
understanding of a computer science - oriented way of thinking ; once you have this under
your belt, you can apply it to infinitely many fields / projects. I also passionately enjoyed
this class - taking this class is the reason I realized I want to do software engineering
full-time after graduation. Thank you, Ming!
4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
Power of API's / using others' source code / open source code / not reinventing the wheel - again, 
prior to this class, I had only ever written code in C++. Online info was always menially helpful.
But this class taught me the value of using others' source code - like an API - in the field
of web programming.
How the web works :) - KINDA. I found the distinction between web browser and server really 
interesting and significant. I still have a lot to learn, but this distinction made conceptual
sense to me.
5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Can't say I fully understand AJAX - if I want to be a successful web programmer, I will have
to fully understand this concept.
