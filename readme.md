1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
To host all my semester projects for Comp20!
2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was probably the semester group project. It's been really fun using our
freedom to make whatever we wanted to make. With lots of assignments in C++, I at times felt
limited by the meticulous syntax of the language and its emphasis on time & space complexities. But
with HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT, there are so many resources available - from API's, to clear
stackoverflow posts, the open source nature of web dev made me feel excited about all that I have
the potential to create. This all came together for me in the semester project.
3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
So much! Prior to this class, I had focused on data structures and algorithms in C++, and I
was intimidated to try anything else. This class has really taught me the value of a foundational
understanding of a computer science principles; once you have this under
your belt, you can apply it to infinitely many fields / projects. I also passionately enjoyed
this class - taking this class is the reason I realized I want to do software engineering
full-time after graduation. Thank you, Ming!
4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
First point would be the power of API's / using others' source code / open source code / not reinventing the wheel - again, 
prior to this class, I had done all my assignments on data structures and algo. For this stuff, online 
info was menially helpful, at best. But this class taught me the value of using others' source code 
- like an API - in the field of web programming.
My second greatest takeaway is how the web works. I found the distinction between web browser and server really 
interesting and significant. I still have a lot to learn, but this distinction made conceptual
sense to me.
5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'd like to get a deeper understanding AJAX and databases.
