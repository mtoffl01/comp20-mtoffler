1. I think everything has been correctly implemented!
2. I discussed the assignment with Wei-Ren Murray, and two other girls
	I sat with during Monday's office hours - don't know their names, though!
	They helped me understand the difference between my "rides" data structure and
	the rides["vehicles"] part of this structure
3. I probably spent about 8 hours on the assignment. There was a lot I just didn't
	understand, like trying to access rides versus rides["vehicles"]...
